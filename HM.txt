Indemnity Plans

Indemnity Plans are sometimes called “Fee-for-service” Plans. They typically require the participant to :
Pay the medical care provider directly for services.
File claims to be reimbursed by the plan.

Participants can seek care from any doctor or hospital and receive benefits.
Hospital per-certification is required for some services in order to receive the highest level of benefits. Indemnity Plans :
Pay reasonable and customary (Insurance companies determine fees charged for health services according to geographic areas, also referred to as usual and customary or usual and prevailing) deductible (Annual amounts required to be paid by the insured before benefits become payable by the health plan. Most health plans have individual and family deductibles. When the combined deductibles for all individuals equal the family deductible, no further deductibles are due.) coinsurance (The percentage of charges that a customer pays for covered services in addition to any applicable deductibles.) amounts, up to an out-of-pocket maximum.
Rely on utilization management (The process that health plans and insures use to determine the medical necessity of treatment and care that a patient is receiving, determined by licensed clinicians. Utilization management most frequently applies to hospital stays, but also can include the appropriate use of other health care services( e.x. expensive diagnostic tests).) to control costs.

Health Maintenance Organization (HMO)

An HMO provides prepaid benefits for most health care needs with no bills or claim forms.
An HMO provides services through a select group of doctors, hospitals, and other providers who are under contract to the HMO. To choose an HMO option, participants must live or work in an area supported by the HMO network- as defined by their home ZIP Codes.
Participants choose a Primary Care Physician (PCP) from a list of physicians.
Participants do not pay deductibles, but are required to pay a copayments each time they visit a provider.
Only services rendered by the PCP or from a provider referred by the PCP will be reimbursed.
HMOs provide preventive care and rely on utilization management to control costs.
In-Network
	Employees living in an HMO’s service area, as defined by their home ZIP codes, are eligible to join that HMO and must choose and in-network PCP or facility from a list of providers in the service area.
	Using in-network providers offers the participant the highest level of benefits.
Out-of-Network
	Participants who receive out-of-network medical services from providers other than the PCP without a referral typically do not receive benefits coverage.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preferred Provider Organization (PPO)

A PPO is a network of contracted participating physicians and hospitals that agree to render their services at discounted rates.
PPOs maintain networks of participating doctors and hospitals; however, participants are not required to choose a PCP to coordinate their care.
Participants have the choice of using in-network or out-of network providers.

In-Network:
	Using in-network providers offers the participant the highest level of benefits. By staying in-network, the participant :
Pay a lower deductible.
Pays office visit copayments.
Receives preferred coinsurance.
Receives preferred benefits.
Pre-certifies service.
Files claims (sometimes).

Out-Of-Network :
Such benefits are available to the participant during periods of illness or injury. At all other times, using out-of-network providers results in a lower level of benefits being paid. By going out of network, the participant:
Pays a higher deductible.
Pays higher coinsurance.
Pays reasonable and customary charges.
Receives lower benefit levels.
Pre-certifies and file claims (sometimes).
Uses Balance billing (Billing a patient for what is over & above the contracted schedule of fees or beyond the reasonable and customary amount; this is not covered by the plan).


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Point of Service Plan (POS)

POS plans have networks of participating doctors and hospitals that provide medical care at negotiated rates.
Employees living in a POS service area, as defined by their home ZIP codes are eligible to join that POS and must choose and in-network PCP or facility from a list of providers in the service area.

In-Network
To receive the plan’s highest level of benefits, participants need to receive care from the PCP or get a referral from the PCP to another in-network provider, Staying in-network
The PC files claims for all coordinated care.
The participant may need to file claims for claims for any services not coordinated by the PCP.
Out-Of-Network
POS plans pay a lower benefit when using out of network providers, Going out-of-network :
May result in the need to pay the full amount for services up front and file claims for reimbursement.
Applies an annual deductible, and the plan pays a percentage of covered reasonable and customary expenses.
Requires the participant to pay coinsurance up to the out-of-pocket maximum. Once the participant reaches the annual out-of-pocket maximum, the plan pays 100% of most covered expenses for the rest of the plan year.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Exclusive Provider Organization (EPO)


An EPO closely resembles an HMO. Benefits are provided within a specific contracted network of physicians and hospitals with no out-of-network; it can be described as self-funded HMO.	
EPO Plans require participants to choose a PCP from a list of physicians. Participants do not have to pay deductibles, but are required to pay a predetermined copayment each time they visit a provider.
The provider is required to recertify service. Only services rendered by the PCP or from a provider referred by the PCP will be reimbursed. The provider files all claims for reimbursement and does not require balance billing.
EPOs provide preventive care and rely on utilization management to control costs.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Consumer-Driven


Consumer Driven plans provide an option for employers to control the rising costs of health care while increasing the value that employees preceive for their health care benefits.
Participant select different components (ex. – coinsurance, copayment( of their plan at out-of-pocket rates that best suit their individual health care & family needs
Types –
Health Care Reimbursement Account (HRA) Plans
Health Care Spending Account (HSA) Plans

Health Care Reimbursement Account (HRA) Plans
		HRAs typically include:
A high deductible medical plan
Employer contributes funds to the HRA and the employee draws against it.
Employees participating in HRA plans pay for their health care services until they meet their deductibles, which are usually higher than other health plan options. During this period, participants learn to consider both quality and cost in making health care decision-providing savings for both employers and employees. The employer contributes money to an HRA and the participant draws against it for situations/services not covered by the medical plan (which offsets the participant’s out-of-pocket expenses.) It also provides employees with the ability to build their account balance over time.


Health Care Spending Account (HSA) Plans:
	Employers provide a trust or custodial account established on behalf of the participant. The amounts contributed accumulate on a tax-free basis and are not subject to taxes if participants use the money to pay medical expenses for themelves or their dependents.	
The Plan allows:
Money contributed by employee, employer, or both.
No specific annual limit on employer contributions; however, most employers do set an annual limit.
Unused money can be rolled into the next year.
Once participants attain age 65, the HSA may be used to pay for most retiree medical expenses or toher medical expenses on a tax-free basis. Participants could also use the money for non medical reasons; however, that money would be taxed at the ordinary income tax rate.

Indemnity plans requires participant to :
Pay a deductible each plan year.
Pay coinsurance.
Have an annual Out-of-Pocket (OOP) maximum, Once the OOP is attained, the plan pays 100% of most covered expenses for the rest of the plan year.

Possible alternative treatments that may be more cost-effective.

Participants should request a pretreatment estimate:
If a procedure is expected to cost more than a specified dollar amount.
To determine whether the procedure will be covered by the plan.
